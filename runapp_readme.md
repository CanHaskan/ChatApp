# SmackApp (ChatApp)

**SmackApp** (a.k.a. ChatApp) is an iOS chat application written in Swift. It uses Firebase for authentication, realtime messaging / Firestore, and Storage for media. Networking helpers use Alamofire and the project optionally supports Socket.IO for custom realtime backends.

> This README was generated by ChatGPT from the typical project structure (`Podfile`, `.xcworkspace`, `Smack/`), and common chat-app patterns. If you want changes after you paste it into your repo, tell me what to adjust and I'll update it.

## About
SmackApp is a sample chat application demonstrating typical real-time messaging features on iOS. It includes user registration & login, one-to-one chat, image upload, profile pictures, and optional socket-backed features for low-latency messaging.

This repo contains an Xcode project (workspace if CocoaPods used), Podfile and the `Smack/` source folder containing views, services and models.

---

## Features
- Email/password authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Real-time messaging (Firestore or Realtime DB)
- Image upload & avatar storage (Firebase Storage)
- Conversation list and message threads
- Sending text and image messages
- Alamofire wrappers for REST endpoints (if needed)
- Optional Socket.IO client for custom backends
- Basic push notification support (FCM)

---

## Requirements
- macOS with Xcode 13+ (use Xcode version compatible with the project’s Swift version)
- Swift 5+
- CocoaPods OR Swift Package Manager
- A Firebase project (console)

---

## Installation

### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CanHaskan/ChatApp.git
cd ChatApp
```

### Dependencies (CocoaPods / SPM)
**If the repo uses CocoaPods** (there is a `Podfile`):
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods   # if you don't have CocoaPods
pod install
open SmackApp.xcworkspace
```

**If the repo uses Swift Package Manager (SPM)**:
- Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` in Xcode and use **File → Swift Packages → Add Package Dependency...**
- Common packages used: `Alamofire`, `Socket.IO-Client-Swift`, `Firebase` (via SPM if configured).

### Firebase setup
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com and create a project (e.g. `SmackApp-Dev`).
2. Add an iOS app in the Firebase console with your app's bundle identifier.
3. Enable **Authentication → Sign-in method → Email/Password**.
4. Create **Firestore** (or Realtime Database) and set appropriate development rules.
5. Create **Storage** for avatars and media.
6. (Optional) Enable **Cloud Messaging** for push notifications.

### GoogleService-Info.plist
- Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase and add it to the Xcode project (Target Membership enabled).
- **Do not** commit this file to public repos if you want to keep keys private. Add it to `.gitignore` if required.

### Open project
- If you used CocoaPods: open `SmackApp.xcworkspace`
- Otherwise open `SmackApp.xcodeproj`
- Build & Run on a simulator or physical device.

---

## Configuration

### Environment & Constants
Look for a `Constants.swift`, `Config.plist` or `Environment.xcconfig` in the repo. Typical keys:
```swift
struct API {
  static let baseURL = "https://api.example.com"
  static let socketURL = "https://socket.example.com"
}
```
If your project expects keys in a `.plist` or `.xcconfig`, add the values locally and do not commit secrets.

## Architecture & Folder Structure
A recommended (and commonly used) layout in this project:
```
SmackApp/
├─ Smack/                 # App source files
│  ├─ AppDelegate.swift
│  ├─ SceneDelegate.swift
│  ├─ Services/
│  │  ├─ FirebaseService.swift
│  │  ├─ SocketService.swift
│  │  └─ APIService.swift
│  ├─ Views/
│  │  ├─ LoginVC.swift
│  │  ├─ RegisterVC.swift
│  │  └─ ChatVC.swift
│  ├─ Models/
│  │  ├─ User.swift
│  │  └─ Message.swift
│  └─ Utils/
│     ├─ Constants.swift
│     └─ Extensions.swift
├─ Podfile
├─ SmackApp.xcworkspace
└─ README.md
```

---

## Common Commands
```bash
# Install pods
pod install

# Build
xcodebuild -workspace SmackApp.xcworkspace -scheme SmackApp -sdk iphonesimulator

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -workspace SmackApp.xcworkspace -scheme SmackApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
```

---

## Troubleshooting
- **App fails to find Firebase app**: Make sure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added to the correct target and included in target membership.
- **Missing pods / build errors**: Run `pod install` and open the workspace, not the project file.
- **Socket connection fails**: Check server URL, CORS, token headers, and server logs.
- **Large media uploads fail**: Compress images before upload or use Firebase resumable uploads.
